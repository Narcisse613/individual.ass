    <p>Point of sale (POS) system is the spot where your customer makes the payment for goods or services that are offered by your company.

        Point of sale systems are systems that enable the business transaction between the client and the company to be completed. POS system is a computerized network that consists of the main computer linked with several checkout terminals and supported by different hardware features starting from barcode scanners and ending with card payment terminals.
        
        As businesses have different profiles they need various point of sale systems as well. For example, restaurants, retail businesses, and grocery stores all have their specialties and that is why they need a POS system that meets their specific needs.
        
        A food store requires a scale at the point of sale and a cafe needs to have an opportunity to customize menus in case of special offers.
        
        But in general, there are two primary types of businesses that need the point of sales system. These are retail companies and hospitality businesses such as restaurants and hotels. That also means that there are mainly two suitable POS systems one for retail and the other for restaurant businesses.</p>
